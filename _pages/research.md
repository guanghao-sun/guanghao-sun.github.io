## *Detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography*

> Identifying malignant masses in mammography images before a biopsy remains a challenging task for radiologists. In particular, our study sample intentionally excluded lesions with clear and distinct features that are easily identifiable by radiologists and have already been used as a basis for determining suspicious cases.We aim to establish a framework based on this study that can be used to explore additional clinical biomarkers and risk assessment criteria, helping radiologists identify suspicious lesions and improve the current diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography.

## *Quadrotor UAV*

> In the medical domain, acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations is often difficult due to the lack of experienced annotators and visual ambiguity in object boundaries.

## *Tillering Recognition of Wheat Based on Adaptive Linear Spanning Network*

> With only unlabeled data available, we can transfer the knowledge learned from virtually synthesized labeled data, public labeled data, or labeled data from other medical centers (source domain data) to our unlabeled target domain data. In this scenario, when directly applied to target data, fully supervised learning models that learn on source data usually result in significant performance degradation and show unsatisfactory generalizability due to the domain gap. For instance, colonoscopy images from multiple centers often exhibit different imaging conditions, such as illumination effect and color distribution, because imaging devices and parameter settings are not well standardized. Therefore, bridging the domain gap is the key to effectively leveraging cross-domain labeled data for improving generalizability on unlabeled target domain data. We are interested in unsupervised domain adaptation, source free domain adaptation, and open-set domain adaptation.
