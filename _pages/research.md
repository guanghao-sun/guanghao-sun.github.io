## *Detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography*

> Identifying malignant masses in mammography images before a biopsy remains a challenging task for radiologists. In particular, our study sample intentionally excluded lesions with clear and distinct features that are easily identifiable by radiologists and have already been used as a basis for determining suspicious cases.We aim to establish a framework based on this study that can be used to explore additional clinical biomarkers and risk assessment criteria, helping radiologists identify suspicious lesions and improve the current diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography.

## *Quadrotor UAV*

> In the medical domain, acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations is often difficult due to the lack of experienced annotators and visual ambiguity in object boundaries.

## *Tillering Recognition of Wheat Based on Adaptive Linear Spanning Network*

> With only unlabeled data available, we can transfer the knowledge learned from virtually synthesized labeled data, public labeled data, or labeled data from other medical centers (source domain data) to our unlabeled target domain data. In this scenario, when directly applied to target data, fully supervised learning models that learn on source data usually result in significant performance degradation and show unsatisfactory generalizability due to the domain gap. For instance, colonoscopy images from multiple centers often exhibit different imaging conditions, such as illumination effect and color distribution, because imaging devices and parameter settings are not well standardized. Therefore, bridging the domain gap is the key to effectively leveraging cross-domain labeled data for improving generalizability on unlabeled target domain data. We are interested in unsupervised domain adaptation, source free domain adaptation, and open-set domain adaptation.

## *Non-contact object shape and size measurement*

> A non-contact object shape and size automatic measurement device is designed and fabricated. The device can measure the shape, size, the center point of the measuring head and the cover of the measured target
The distance between the targets and other parameters are measured, and the laser beam is used to indicate the central position of the measured target. The background plate was placed vertically 5cm behind the target and a certain rule was selected
The shape of the plane target is placed on the centerline position of the placement area of the measured target, and the measurement is started after pressing the measurement key. After the measurement is completed, the target is displayed on the device
Object side length or diameter, geometry and distance between the target and the measuring head, the whole measurement and indication process requires a total time of no more than 2 minutes to replace the target plate, in the pendulum
The target and background plates are placed on the center line of the placement area, and the distance, shape and size (side length) are displayed. It is required that the measurement time is not more than 2 minutes. Automatically finding objects
Measurement: the measuring head is in the center line direction (0ยบ), and the target is placed at any position in the target placement area; After pressing the test button, the device automatically looks for the target and measures
And display the distance, shape, size, using a laser pointer to indicate the geometric center, take no more than 3 minutes, the shorter the better. Stereo target measurement: randomly selected basketball,
One of volleyball and football, repeat the measurement, judge the ball variety, and measure the closest distance to the surface of the ball. It takes no more than two minutes.
